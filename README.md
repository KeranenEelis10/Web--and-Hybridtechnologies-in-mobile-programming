To test these codes or assignments open up VScode and VScode terminal and insert these lines:

-> npx create-expo-app "desired project name" ( after creating the project pull it from its stored location to VScode)
-> cd "file name that you gave"

Creating expo app should create yourself project with three folders (.expo, assets, node_modules) and five files ( App.js, app.json, babel.config.js, package-lock.json, package.json)
After creating project navigate to an assignment of your choice and copy or replace the content of the assignment to your own project.
For example if you want to test Viikkoteht4 copy the folders (if there is any) to the root of yout project.
Then copy the contents of App.js and replace them in to your own App.js
Apply the same instructions to rest of the assignments but remember to delete previous folders and App.js contents before testing another assignment

Insert this line to terminal:

-> npx expo start

After starting the project a QR code should appear in terminal which you need scan with Expo Go app in your mobile device
Scanning the QR code with Expo Go gives you a view of functions that were required in each assignment
